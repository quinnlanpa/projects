poissonpressure.m is a MATLAB file that solves the stokes equations using a pressure poisson formulation. 
The method is outlined in the .pdf included. This code was written for MATH 447 Computational Fluid Dynamics in spring 2024
The method utilises finite difference approximations using periodic BCs and uniform grid spacing.
