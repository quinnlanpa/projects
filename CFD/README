poissonpressure.m is a MATLAB file that solves the stokes equations using a pressure poisson formulation, essentatilly breaking the equation in to 13 poisson solves. 
The method is outlined in the .pdf included.
The method utilises finite difference approximations using periodic BCs and uniform grid spacing.
